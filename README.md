# Cracking-the-Data-Science-Interview
A list of resources for our society members who have upcoming interviews! This repo should serve as a great place to recap some data science knowledge as well as test yourself.


## Introduction
Data science interviews aren't easy. Companies are often looking for people with a large array of skills from programming (namely Python and SQL) to statistics and mathematics. The Data Science Society is committed to helping you achieve that dream job in this amazing and rapidly growing field. Our committee members have been through this interview process many times and so we decided to collect all our resources together in one place.

## 1. Python
Arguably the most important skill of a modern day data scientist is the ability to code. In line with our [**Lecture Series**](https://github.com/Imperial-College-Data-Science-Society/Lecture-1-Intro-to-Python) in Python, here are some revision resources:

 - [Python Crash Course Cheatsheets](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/cheatsheets/README.html)
	 - Basic Python knowledge condensed down into downloadable documents
- [LearnXinYMinutes - Python3](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python3/)
	- One page Python knowledge from variables to classes and wrapper functions
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)
	- Try some problem questions (recommended to start with Easy level problems)

## 2. Scientific Python w/ Pandas
We're looking to find cool insights in our data but this is only possible if we know how to data wrangle properly using Pandas, the Python library:

- [Pandas Revision](https://dshahid380.github.io/Data-analysis-with-pandas/)
	- A series of short notebooks providing an overview of the library
- [Pandas Lecture Series - Data School](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5-da3qGB5ICCsgW1MxlZ0Hq8LL5U3u9y)
	- Learning via videos instead of reading notebooks
- [Pandas Questions & Exercises](https://github.com/guipsamora/pandas_exercises#getting-and-knowing)
	- List of (very) short projects/questions to test your Pandas knowledge
